# Folder Cleanup Script

This script is designed to delete a specified folder, its contents, and all folders within its parent directory. Additionally, the script deletes itself after execution.

## How It Works

1. Deletes all contents inside the specified target folder.
2. Deletes the specified target folder itself.
3. Deletes all folders within the parent directory of the specified target folder.
4. Deletes the script file itself.

## Usage

1. Save the script to a file, for example, `delete_folders.sh`.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x delete_folders.sh
   ```
3. Run the script with the target folder as an argument:
   ```bash
   ./delete_folders.sh /path/to/target/folder
   ```

## Example

Given the following folder structure:

```
/Root
└── /Parent
    └── /Child
        └── /TargetFolder
            └── script.sh (this script)
```

If you run the script with `TargetFolder` as the target:

1. The script will delete everything inside `/Root/Parent/Child/TargetFolder`.
2. The script will delete the `/Root/Parent/Child/TargetFolder` folder itself.
3. The script will delete all folders within `/Root/Parent/Child`.
4. The script will delete itself.

After running the script, the structure will look like:

```
/Root
└── /Parent
    └── /Child (now empty, if there were no other files)
```

## Warning

**Use this script with caution.** The `rm -rf` command can cause significant data loss if used improperly. Always ensure you have backups or have confirmed the contents of the directories before running the script.
